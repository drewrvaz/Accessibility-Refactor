# Module-01-Homework

## Description

This project was an opportunity to build my professional portfolio. This project was built as a way to showcase my skill with CSS and HTML to potential employers. This project made the webpage more accessible. I learned how to refractor code to make it more accessible, and what components may need to be addressed in order for it to make it more accessible.
