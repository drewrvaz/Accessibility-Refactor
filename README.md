## Description

This project was an opportunity to build my professional portfolio. This project was built as a way to showcase my skill with CSS and HTML to potential employers. This project made the webpage more accessible. I learned how to refractor code to make it more accessible, and what components may need to be addressed in order for it to make it more accessible.

In order to install this code, clone the code from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/drewrvaz/Module-01-Homework.
